v1.1.8.0
- HTTP/2 is used by default now.
- Updated dependencies.

v1.1.7.0
- WebDavSession.ListAsync methods now have an optional parameter specifying a UriKind (default is UriKind.Absolute). By this parameter, the format of the Uris of the resulting WebDavSessionListItems can be specified.
- Removed the unused property IWebProxy from WebDavSession. If a proxy should be used, use one of the constructors of WebDavSession accepting a HttpMessageHandler and provide information about a proxy with a HttpClientHandler.

v1.1.6.0
- The library now supports number signs ('#') in URLs which is usually a special character in URLs (fragment).

v1.1.5.0:
- Bugfix: WebDavClient/WebDavSession methods for copy/move failed when destination Uri contained special characters.
- UriHelper: New method EscapePathSegments which escapes only the path segments of a Uri/URL.

v1.1.4.0
- WebDavSession: New property ThrowExceptions: The methods of WebDavSession usually only return a boolean value indicating if the operation completed successfully. If more information about a failed operation is needed, the WebDvSession has a new property ThrowExceptions. If set to true, errors during WebDAV operations are thrown as exceptions. This property defaults to false.
- WebDavSession: All constructors now have an optional parameter throwExceptions which defaults to false.
- WebDavSession/WebDavClient: Removed unnecessary async calls in overloads of methods.
- Updated references.

v1.1.3.0
- WebDavSession: New overload for DownloadFileWithProgressAsync accepting a WebDavSessionItem to download.
- WebDavClient: Added missing method overloads.

v1.1.2.0
- WebDavHelper: Added method to receive the ActiveLock from a WebDavResponseMessage.

v1.1.1.0
- WebDavClient: Added missing overload for Mkcol accepting an URI/URL and a CancellationToken.

v1.1.0.0
- Added full HTTP/2 support. The default HTTP version is still HTTP/1.1 for compatibility reasons (Xamarin). Use the overloaded constructors or the property HttpVersion (WebDavClient/WebDavSession) to use HTTP/2 instead.
- The WebDavSession now exposes the DefaultRequestHeaders of the underlying WebDavClient. By using this property, default headers can be set which should be sent with every request of the WebDavSession.

v1.0.1.0
- Bugfix [Xamarin]: WebDavSession.ListAsync returned wrong URLs when used with folders containing spaces.
- Bugfix [Xamarin]: WebDavSession.ListAsync returned the containing folder when used with folders containing spaces.

v1.0.0.0
- Extension of the Portable WebDAV Library's WebDAV object model: Properties which are not defined in RFC 4918, RFC 4331, Additional WebDAV Collection Properties or IIS WebDAV specification can now also be accessed through the library's WebDAV object model. These unknown properties are exposed as XML (when using WebDavClient) or are handled by the class AdditionalProperties (when using WebDavSession/WebDavSessionItem). See the documentation for instructions on how to use unknown WebDAV properties with the library.
- Renamed WebDavSesionListItem to WebDavSessionItem.
- WebDavSession now supports Proppatch operations with the methods UpdateItemAsync and UpdateItemsAsync: Use the ListAsync methods to retrieve WebDavSessionItems, then change the properties of these items. Finally you can use the methods UpdateItemAsync/UpdateUtemsAsync of WebDavSession passing the changed WebDavSessionItems in oder to update the item's properties on the server (Proppatch). Note that not all WebDAV servers support Proppatch for all properties. So maybe you will not be able to change properties of a WebDAV element with these methods.
- The methods of WebDavSession (e.g. copy, mode, delete, etc.) can now be used by specifying a WebDavSessionItem.
- New methods for WebDavSession (GetSupportedPropertyNamesAsync) to retrieve a list of WebDAV properties supported by a WebDAV item.
- The library now contains a DebugHttpMessageHandler: This handler can be used for WebDavClient and WebDavSesion in order to get the request/response (and their content) printed on the debug console. Note that this message handler should not be used in a productive environment.
- The constructors expecting credentials now use the interface ICredentials for credentials.
- Bugfix: UriHelper.CombineUri sometimes threw exception when both URIs were the same.

v0.9.1.0
- Security: Updated dependencies to System.Net.Http (see Microsoft Security Advisory 4021279: Vulnerabilities in .NET Core, ASP.NET Core Could Allow Elevation of Privilege: https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/12).

 v0.9.0.0
- The library now implements RFC 4918, RFC 4331, Additional WebDAV Collection Properties and a some WebDAV properties specific to IIS WebDAV.
- New properties available for WebDavSessionListItem: Keep in mind that not every WebDAV server supports the same properties. Often a server only supports a subset of the specifications or even adds additional properties. So, when a property of a WebDavSessionListItem is null, the WebDAV server may not support these properties.
- Some properties of WebDavSessionListItem are strongly-typed now (DateTime and numeric values).
- WebDavSession now exposes some protected members, so that the class can be overridden for special purposes (e.g. when new types should be added to the WebDAV object model in a project).

v0.8.2.0
- The classes AbsoluteUri, CodedUrl and NoTagList do not provide public constructors anymore so that the specification cannot be bypassed. Use the TryPase methods to create an instance of these classes.
- AbsoluteUri.ToString: Do not try to parse, de- or encode the URI.

v0.8.1.0
- New Timeout property for WebDavSession (default timeout value is 100 seconds).

v0.8.0.0
- When using WebDavClient.DownloadFileWithProgressAsync, the passed Stream does not get disposed automatically. Disposing of this Stream is up to the client calling this method.
- Strongly typed versions of Lock-Token formats as defined in WebDAV specification.
- When using the Portable WebDAV Library on Xamarin, there was a problem when relative URLs (strings) where used (e.g. webDavSession.ListAsync(@"/folder")).
- When using WebDavSession, a base URL (string) can now be specified.
- The 'Translate' header is always set to 'f' for IIS WebDAV serving unmapped file types (see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc250063.aspx).
- Bugfix: When using WebDavSession with BaseUri and calling methods passing only the relative Uri/URL to a file, these operations always failed.
- Bugfix: When using WebDavSession.UploadFileWithProgressAsync with a URL, there was a stack overflow exception because the method called itself instead of the correct overload.

v0.7.0.0
- The library now targets .NETStandard 1.1 (.NET Core) and can be used on any platform supporting .NETStandard 1.1.
- Due to .NETStandard support, the library is not separated into two parts (UWP/NetFx) anymore. One library for all the target platforms.
- **Breaking change**: The whole library is now based on System.Net.Http.HttpClient. Therefore, there are some changes in the API (e.g. method signatures).
- Upload/download with progress is generally supported, even on projects targeting .NET Framework (formerly the NetFx part of the library).
- The xml:lang attribute is now supported for prop elements.

v0.6.3.0
- **Breaking change**: The owner element now allows any content. If a URL or e mail address should be provided (as simple string), use the property OwnerHref. This is the same behavior as in previous versions of the library. When child elements, mixed content, text content or attributes should be provided for the owner, use the new property OwnerRaw.
- Due to these changes, the owner is not a separate object (WebDavArtifacts) anymore, but represented by the properties OwnerHref and OwnerRaw in the classes ActiveLock and LockInfo.
- WebDavClient: All method overloads accepting a URL as string now construct the Uri with UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute, so relative URLs can be specified.
-  Changed formatting of Lock-Token header as defined in RFC 4918.

v0.6.2.0
- Added missing property 'SupportedLock' as defined in [RFC 4918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-6.7).
- The class LockToken now exposes the internal LockToken value for serialization purposes.
- NetFx: The response headers are now transparently added to the WebDavResponseMessage (i.e. without validation).
- Bugfix: Fix incorrect checks on the existence of the LockToken header in responses.

v0.6.1.0:
- WebDavSession: WebDavSession: new overloads for DownloadFileAsync.
- Bugfix: Fixed problems when URLs were HTML encoded.
- Bugfix: Fixed problems when combining URIs/URLs.
- Workaround when a server returns an invalid ETag header (NetFx only).

v0.6.0.0:
- New overloads for UriHelper.CombineUri supporting a second parameter indicating if duplicated path segments of the second URI should be removed from the resulting URI. E.g. when this parameter is set to true, combining the URIs https://myserver.com/webdav and /webdav/myfile.txt will result in https://myserver.com/webdav/myfile.txt (not https://myserver.com/webdav/webdav/myfile.txt). When this parameter is set to false (or by using the overload omitting this parameter), the URIs simply get combined as they are.
- New overloads for UriHelper.AddTrailingSlash supporting a second parameter indicating if a file is expected in the URI/URL. Before this change, this method did not work with folder names containing a dot ('.').
- New overloads for several methods in UriHelper accepting URLs as string.
- Bugfix: Sometimes WebDavSession.ListAsync also returned the parent (containing) folder (due to wrong combination of URIs).
- Bugfix: Fixed error parsing boolean properties for WebDavSessionListItem.
- WebDavSession.ListAsync: The WebDAV library now uses the original port specified in the request to build the response (if the response comes from a different port internally). 
- New method in UriHelper to remove the port from an URI/URL.
- WebDavSession.ListAsync: When a Prop's DisplayName contains unreadable characters, the last part of the URI is used as WebDavSession ListItem's name instead.

v0.5.3.0:
- Bugfix: Fixed error with combining base URI and relative URI for WebDavSession. 

v0.5.2.0:
- WebDavSession.ListAsync now uses 'allprop' as default.
- New overloads for WebDavSession.ListAsync where a PropFind can be specified (e.g. PropFind.CreatePropFindWithEmptyPropertiesAll()). 
- Updated and improved documentation. 

v0.5.1.0:
- Bugfix: WebDavSession.ListAsync delivered the containing folder if the requested folder path contained spaces. 
- The class PropFind now contains a method to create an empty PropFind (CreatePropFind). With such a PropFind, the server should return all properties known to the server.

v0.5.0.0:
- BREAKING CHANGE: WebDavSession.ListAsync now returns WebDavSessionListItems which contain all WebDAV properties available.
- WebDavSession.ListAsync now returns WebDavSessionListItems with full qualified URIs (not relative URIs anymore).
- Extension of WebDAV object model: Implementation of RFC 4331 (Quota and Size Properties for Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV) Collections).
- New methods for uploading/downloading files with progress (UWP only).
- Fixed a few things in the documentation.

v0.4.0.0:
- New method overloads in WebDavClient without requiring a LockToken
- NuGet package available: https://www.nuget.org/packages/PortableWebDavLibrary/

v0.3.0.0:
- Split the Portable WebDAV Library into two parts: DecaTec.WebDav.NetFx.dll (to be used in projects targeting  the .NET Framework, Windows 8 or ASP.NET Core) and DecaTec.WebDav.Uwp.dll (to be used in projects targeting Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1 and apps for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP))
- The split was necessary because there were some issues using the Portable WebDAV Library in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) projects (not being able to ignore invalid SSL certificates and a bug in System.Net.Http.HttpClient making it impossible to access WebDAV resources without receiving an exception). Maybe the Portable WebDAV Library gets merged into one DLL in the future, but as long as there is no consistent API to access web resources in .NET and UWP apps, the library will consist of these two parts

v0.2.0.0:
- Retarget for .NET 4.5 and ASP.NET Core 5.0
- The WebDavSession now uses the class NetworkCredential for user credentials. The class WebDavCredential is not longer supported

v0.1.1.0:
- Optimized URL handling in WebDavSession
- Added a more meaningful WebDavException when ListAsync (WebDavSession) fails due to wrong response status code
- WebDavException is now thrown when parsing a response (multi status or prop) fails

v0.1.0.0:
- Initial release of Portable WebDAV Library
