# Project description

The Portable WebDAV Library is a strongly typed, async WebDAV client library which is fully compliant to [RFC 4918](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918), [RFC 4331](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4331), [Additional WebDAV Collection Properties](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hopmann-collection-props-00) and a some WebDAV properties specific to IIS WebDAV. It is implemented as [.NETStandard 1.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library) library in oder to be used on any platform supporting .NETStandard 1.1.

# Main project aims
* Full compliance to [RFC 4918 (*HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)*)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918), [RFC 4331 (*Quota and Size Properties for Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV) Collections*)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4331) and [*Additional WebDAV Collection Properties*](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hopmann-collection-props-00)
* Portability: The library can be used in any project targeting .NETStandard 1.1
* Level of abstraction: There is a low level of abstraction (class **WebDavClient**) which supports all WebDAV operations directly. This is recommended for users who are familiar with the RFC 4918 specification. A higher level of abstraction is also provided (class **WebDavSession**) that hides most of the WebDAV specific operations and provides an easy access to WebDAV Servers
* Fast and fluid: All operations which might last longer are implemented as asynchronous methods
* WebDAV object model: Object model that represents all WebDAV artifacts used in WebDAV communication (as XML request/response content). No need to build own request XML content strings or parsing the contents of a response of a WebDAV server
* Full HTTP/2 support

So far the project is tested against IIS and ownCloud/Nextcloud (sabre/dav) (note that WebDAV locking is only working with ownCloud 8 or earlier releases as with ownCloud 9 WebDAV locking is not supported anymore).

# Obtaining the library
* There is a NuGet package available: Just search for '**PortableWebDavLibrary**' in the '*Manage NuGet Packages...*' window in Visual Studio. You can also find the package [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PortableWebDavLibrary/).
* If you prefer the manual installation method, you can find the current release as ZIP file on the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/DecaTec/Portable-WebDAV-Library/releases).
 
# Documentation
There is a full documentation of the library with some example code available.

# Beta versions
When there will be some considerable/breaking changes in a future version of the library, a preview version is released on [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/feed/decatec-preview/package/nuget/PortableWebDavLibrary) before releasing the final version on NuGet. This way, projects using the Portable WebDAV Library can test beta versions before a new version is released officially.
